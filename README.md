Also, try the following libraries on the dataset:

    Turicreate
    Surprise


Dataset: MovieLens 20M 

Source: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/


Hints:

1. Read Movies.csv, Ratings.csv and Tags.csv. No need for genome-scores.csv, genome-tags.csv

2. Create content filtering method on metadata obtained from merging movies and tags

3. Metadata should be formed from joining all tag field for each movie_title.

4. Build a Tfidf Vectorizer model and TruncatedSVD for Content filter - Latent matrix 1 on this data

5. Create a Collab filter on User Movie matrix (formed from pivot table on ratings data)

6. Create a Latent matrix 2 on this data

7. Code hybrid model
